This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **[Nuxt3](https://nuxt.com/)** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.



We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **[Nuxt3](https://nuxt.com/)** community styleguides & best practices.
